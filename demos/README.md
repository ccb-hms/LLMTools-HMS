\## 🎥 Demo Video Explanation



The demo video showcases how the \*\*Harvard University Sandbox\*\* can be used to solve two different information-retrieval tasks using large language models and external tools.



\### Demo – Exercise 1: Document Retrieval (PDF)



In the first part of the demo, the system is shown retrieving structured information from a PDF document.  

The demo uploads the scientific journal article (PDF file): **"Massy M, Marti S, Hammer H, Hoepner R. Increased vision impairment reports linked to semaglutide: analysis of FDA adverse event data. BMC Med. 2025 Apr 7;23(1):203. doi: 10.1186/s12916-025-04031-z. PMID: 40189538; PMCID: PMC11974072."** 
It then demonstrates how the model:


\- Digest the relevant document

\- Reads and analyzes the PDF content

\- Answers specific questions of interest, namely:

&nbsp; - The \*\*study methodology\*\*

&nbsp; - The \*\*study conclusions\*\*



This demonstrates the Sandbox’s ability to perform \*\*document understanding and targeted information extraction\*\* from academic PDFs.

\### Demo – Exercise 2: Web Search



In the second part of the demo, the system performs a \*\*live web search\*\* task.  

Given a prompt to find \*\*three recent cancer-research news stories\*\*, the model:



\- Searches the web for up-to-date and relevant sources

\- Identifies recent and credible cancer-research news

\- Summarizes key findings from each news story



This exercise highlights the Sandbox’s ability to integrate \*\*real-time web search\*\* with language-model reasoning to retrieve and summarize current scientific information.

\### Summary



Overall, the demo video illustrates how the Harvard University Sandbox can:

\- Retrieve and analyze information from static documents (PDFs)

\- Search the web for recent information

\- Produce concise, structured summaries suitable for research and academic workflows
