## 🎥 Demo Video Explanation

The demo video showcases how the **Harvard University Sandbox** can be used to solve two different information-retrieval tasks using large language models and external tools.

### Demo – Exercise 1: Document Retrieval (PDF)

In the first part of the demo, the system is shown retrieving structured information from a **PDF document**.  
The demo takes as input the name of a scientific journal article — _“Increased vision impairment reports linked to semaglutide: analysis of FDA adverse event data”_ — and demonstrates how the model:

- Locates the relevant document
- Reads and analyzes the PDF content
- Extracts specific sections of interest, namely:
  - The **study methodology**
  - The **study conclusions**

This demonstrates the Sandbox’s ability to perform **document understanding and targeted information extraction** from academic PDFs.

### Demo – Exercise 2: Web Search

In the second part of the demo, the system performs a **live web search** task.  
Given a prompt to find **three recent cancer-research news stories**, the model:

- Searches the web for up-to-date and relevant sources
- Identifies recent and credible cancer-research news
- Summarizes key findings from each news story

This exercise highlights the Sandbox’s ability to integrate **real-time web search** with language-model reasoning to retrieve and summarize current scientific information.

### Summary

Overall, the demo video illustrates how the Harvard University Sandbox can:
- Retrieve and analyze information from static documents (PDFs)
- Search the web for recent information
- Produce concise, structured summaries suitable for research and academic workflows
