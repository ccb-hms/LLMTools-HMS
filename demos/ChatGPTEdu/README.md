## 🎥 Demo Video Explanation

This demo video showcases how the [**Open AI ChatGPT Edu**](https://chatgpt.com/) can be used for Deep Research and custom GPT (chatbot).
The demo is composed of two exercises:

- Deep Research with LLMs

- Building a Custom Lab Chatbot

Each exercise highlights a different capability, from literature review and reasoning to retrieval-augmented question answering for laboratory protocols.

*Requirements*
- ChatGPT Edu access. To request access, go to [ChatGPT Edu Account Request](https://harvard.service-now.com/ithelp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=b8db9dd34743961096ddb79c416d43c0)

### Exercise 1: Deep Research

The exercise demonstrates how ChatGPT Edu can support deep scientific research by performing a structured literature review on *p53 to design cancer treatment*. 

In this exercise, ChatGPT is used to conduct a literature review on the tumor suppressor p53, with the goal of informing cancer therapy design. To ensure the output is tailored to specific research needs, the GPT model first asks clarifying follow-up questions, such as:

- Which cancer types to focus on

- Relevant therapeutic strategies (e.g., small molecules, gene therapy, immunotherapy)

- Desired time range of the literature

- Expected length and depth of the review

This demonstrates how LLMs can move beyond generic summaries and instead produce customized, research-grade outputs.

###  Exercise 2: Custom Chatbot for a Research Lab

The objective of this exercise is to build a custom chatbot designed to answer protocol-related questions for a laboratory studying human neurons. Researchers can query the chatbot with questions such as:

- Step-by-step protocol clarifications

- Reagent or timing checks

The chatbot uses lab-specific protocols from [JoVE](https://app.jove.com/), enabling accurate and context-aware responses. The following protocols are added to the knowledge base:
 - [Skin Punch Biopsy Explant Culture for Derivation of Primary Human Fibroblasts](https://app.jove.com/v/3779/skin-punch-biopsy-explant-culture-for-derivation-primary-human)
 - [Isolation of Adult Human Dermal Fibroblasts from Abdominal Skin and Generation of Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Using a Non-Integrating Method](https://app.jove.com/v/60629/isolation-adult-human-dermal-fibroblasts-from-abdominal-skin)

This exercise demonstrates (1) How to create the chatbot using instructions, (2) How documents are added to the knowledge base, and (3) Example queries and responses showing real-world lab usage.
