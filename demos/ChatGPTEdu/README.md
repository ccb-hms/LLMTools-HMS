### Exercise 1: Information Retrieval From PDF File

In the first part of the demo, the system is shown retrieving structured information from a PDF document.  

The demo uploads the scientific journal article (PDF file): [*Massy M, Marti S, Hammer H, Hoepner R. Increased vision impairment reports linked to semaglutide: analysis of FDA adverse event data. BMC Med. 2025 Apr 7;23(1):203. doi: 10.1186/s12916-025-04031-z. PMID: 40189538; PMCID: PMC11974072.*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40189538/)

It then demonstrates how the model:

- Digest the relevant document

- Reads and analyzes the PDF content

- Answers specific questions of interest:

  - *What is the study methodology*

  - *What are the study conclusions*

This demonstrates the AI Sandbox’s ability to perform document understanding and targeted information extraction from academic PDFs.

###  Exercise 2: Web Search

In the second part of the demo, the system performs a live web search task.  

An LLM that enables web search is selected. Given a prompt to find \*\*three recent cancer-research news stories\*\*, the model:

- Searches the web for up-to-date and relevant sources

- Identifies recent and credible cancer-research news

- Summarizes key findings from each news story

This exercise highlights the AI Sandbox’s ability to integrate **real-time web search** with language-model reasoning to retrieve current scientific information.
