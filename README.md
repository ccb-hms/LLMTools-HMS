## The CCB MedAI Repository ##

This repository contains the `Ollama` class, derived from the [Ollama](https://pypi.org/project/ollama/) project. Its primary goal is to assist you in getting started with Ollama models on your own hardware. The containerized environment is particularly beneficial if you plan to use the Ollama library with an NVIDIA GPU.
